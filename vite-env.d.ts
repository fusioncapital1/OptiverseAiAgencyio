// This file can be used to add triple-slash directives or other global type declarations.
// The original '/// <reference types="vite/client" />' was removed to resolve a
// 'Cannot find type definition' error. This was likely due to the types not being resolved
// in the current environment (e.g., Vite not fully installed or tsconfig.json issue).
// The existing App.tsx functionality, particularly its use of process.env variables
// (injected by Vite's 'define' config), does not strictly require this specific type reference.
//
// If Vite-specific client-side APIs (e.g., import.meta.env, import.meta.hot) are used
// in the future, this reference may need to be restored, and the underlying type
// resolution issue (e.g., ensuring Vite is correctly installed and tsconfig.json
// is properly configured) must be addressed.
